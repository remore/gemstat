= Redmine API Client

Rubygem to access the Redmine API.  Based on the documentation from http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Rest_api_with_ruby

== Usage

*This gem and the Redmine API is under development and subject to change at any notice.*

There is an example script in bin/test.rb showing the basic usage.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
